# times-tables

desc: Simple times table game for kids. This is the first thing I've made all on my own, not following any tutorial or as part of any course.

## What went well:
* I got to really practice and improve on my DOM manipulation skills
* I tried to keep my code DRY and fairly clean, I'm sure it can still be improved but definitely better than some of my earlier stuff
* I split up the css of each page into different files to keep things clean and organized
* I used google and stackoverflow effectively to solve/ get answers for any issues I had :D

## Things to improve:
* Code could probably still be cleaner yet
* It took me a while because I wasn't doing it consistently, so I need to have a better coding routine
